### Team SF Trail
Members:
* Kaveh Issapour
* Chris Conte

So you're a young, hip, tech-head who is fresh out of college, and you have no idea what to do. Armed with the little cash you have saved up from your summer internships (well, what you haven't spent on Soylent and Hoodies), you head out west in search of greater pastures. And thus you have put yourself on the SF trail! Invest your money in the stocks of new and emerging tech companies, then hunt and acquire those same companies. You need to be quick. So keep your eyes open!
